Atliq Executive View Dashboard – Data Validation Report

This document provides a complete overview of data validation checks performed before building the Atliq Executive View Dashboard. Validation ensures the dataset is clean, reliable, and analysis-ready.


 “Business Rules Applied”

Customer code must be unique

Product code must be unique

Sales amount cannot be negative

Dates must lie between 2017–2022


✅ 1. Row Count Validation

Row count was verified for all fact and dimension tables.

Table Name	Row Count
dim_customer	209
dim_Product	397
dim_Market	27

✔ No missing or unexpected rows found.
✔ Row count matches the dataset specification.


✅ 2. Key Column Validation (Master Tables)

Key columns were validated using COUNTROWS vs DISTINCTCOUNT technique.

dim_customer Table-

Key Column: customer_code

Total Rows: 209

Distinct custome_code: 209

Duplicates: 0

Nulls: 0


dim_Product Table-

Key Column: Product_Code

Total Rows: 397

Distinct Product_Code: 397

Duplicates: 0

Nulls: 0


dim_Market Table-

Key Column: Market 

Total Rows: 27

Distinct Market: 27

Duplicates: 0

Nulls: 0


✔ All master tables contain unique and clean key values.
✔ No duplicate master entries found.


✅ 3. Fact Table Validation-(fact_actualas_estimate)

Repeated customer/product codes found → Expected & Valid

No unmatched CustomerID/ProductID

No nulls in critical fields (Date, Customer, Product, Market, Sales Amount)

✔ Fact table is aligned with master tables.


✅ 4. Date Range Validation

Using MIN and MAX DAX checks:

Min Date: 2017-09-01

Max Date: 2022-08-31

✔ Date range matches company data timeline.
✔ No invalid future/past dates found.


✅ 5. Null Value Validation

Key columns were checked for nulls:

Column Name	Null Count
Customer_Code	0
Product_Code	0
Market   	0
Date            0

✔ No null values in essential analytical fields.


✅ 6. Duplicate Check Summary
Table	                  Duplicate Records
dim_Customer	          0
dim_Product               0
dim_Market                0
fact_actuals_estimate     Only transaction repetition (valid)

✔ Dataset is fully duplicate-free where required.

➕ “Tools Used”

Power Query

Power BI DAX

Excel for quick checks


✅ 7. Data Type Validation

Dates → Proper date type

Codes → Text

Sales Amount → Decimal

Quantity → Whole Number

✔ All columns are in correct format for measures and relationships.


✅ 8. Relationships Validation

Star Schema confirmed

Fact tables properly linked with dim_Customer, dim_Product, dim_Market, and dim_Date tables

No circular dependencies

Cross-filter direction: Single → Correct

✔ Model is optimized and clean.


🟢 Final Conclusion

✔ Dataset is clean, accurate, validated, and analysis-ready.
✔ No structural issues found.
✔ Ideal for building an enterprise-level Power BI Dashboard.
